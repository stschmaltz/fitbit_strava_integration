# Fitbit-Strava Integration

This Elixir Phoenix application integrates Fitbit data with Strava, allowing users to sync their Fitbit workouts to their Strava account.

## Features

- OAuth2 authentication with Fitbit
- Fetching user profile from Fitbit
- (Add other features as you implement them)

## Prerequisites

- Elixir 1.12 or later
- Phoenix 1.6 or later
- Erlang 23 or later
- PostgreSQL (if you're using a database)

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fitbit_strava_integration.git
cd fitbit_strava_integration

```

2. Install dependencies:
```

mix deps.get

```

3. Setup environment variables:
Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following content:
```

FITBIT_CLIENT_ID=your_fitbit_client_id
FITBIT_CLIENT_SECRET=your_fitbit_client_secret

```

4. Start the Phoenix server:
```

mix phx.server

```

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

## Usage

1. Visit `/api/fitbit/auth` to start the Fitbit OAuth flow
2. After authentication, you can access `/api/fitbit/profile` to see your Fitbit profile data

## API Endpoints

- `GET /api/fitbit/auth`: Initiates Fitbit OAuth flow
- `GET /api/fitbit/callback`: Handles Fitbit OAuth callback
- `GET /api/fitbit/profile`: Fetches user's Fitbit profile (requires authentication)
